/**
 * In this package, we provide support to combine instances of
 * {@link org.optimizationBenchmarking.utils.math.functions.MathematicalFunction}
 * to efficient compounds. Compound functions implement
 * {@link java.lang.Iterable} and their iterator allow you to iterate over
 * its components.
